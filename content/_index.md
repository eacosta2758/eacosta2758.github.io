description: "I'm a PhD. candidate at the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations [(SALC)](https://salc.uchicago.edu) at [The University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu). Iâ€™m interested in Sanskrit and Bengali literary cultures from the 17th to the early 19th century in Bengal. I engage mostly with Sanskrit and Middle Bengali poetry produced in small royal courts in Central Bengal and their reception during the 19th century. You can read more about my research and my teaching on this site."
