  I'm a student of Sanskrit and Bengali literary cultures. Iâ€™m interested in Sanskrit and Bengali literary cultures from the 17th to the early 19th century in Bengal. I engage mostly with Sanskrit and Middle Bengali poetry produced in small royal courts in Central Bengal and their reception during the 19th century. My work not only explores the late medieval/early modern of Bengal, it also poses questions of how notions of periodization, especially the idea of the middle ages, were used, conceived and deployed in early colonial Bengal. My research encompasses different approaches, ranging from cultural history and philology, medievalism, to environmental history.
